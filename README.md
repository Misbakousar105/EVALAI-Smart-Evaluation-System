Overview: Eval AI is a smart answer evaluation system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to automatically assess and grade descriptive answers written by students. This system aims to reduce manual evaluation time, minimize human errors, and bring consistency to academic assessments.

🎯 Objectives

Automate the process of evaluating descriptive answers.
Ensure fair and unbiased grading.
Improve the efficiency and speed of result generation.
Provide real-time feedback and analytics to educators.

🧠 Key Features

📘 Descriptive Answer Evaluation: Understands the context of student answers using NLP models.
🔁 Automated Grading: Assigns marks based on similarity with key answers, keywords, and context relevance.
📊 Result Visualization: Displays student performance with charts and analytics.
🧪 Flexible Input: Supports plain text input and integration with scanned handwritten text.
💡 Model Explainability: Uses explainable AI techniques to justify the scoring.
🏗️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask or Django)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Transformers
NLP Tools: NLTK / SpaCy / Hugging Face
Database: SQLite / MySQL
Version Control: Git & GitHub
🛠️ How It Works

Teacher uploads or inputs a model (ideal) answer.
Student answers are submitted.
The system:
Preprocesses both answers using NLP techniques.
Computes semantic similarity using transformer-based models (e.g., BERT).
Evaluates grammar, keyword usage, and context coverage.
Assigns scores accordingly.
Results are presented in a user-friendly dashboard.
Feedback is provided by the model.

📈 Results

🚀 Improved evaluation speed by 60-80%.
✅ Achieved scoring accuracy within a tolerance of ±1 mark for most answers.
🧠 Adaptable to various subjects and languages (with appropriate training data).
✅ Advantages

Time-saving for large-scale evaluations.
Reduces subjectivity and bias in manual grading.
Consistent scoring for all students.
Scalable and extendable for institutions.
📦 Future Enhancements

✍️ Handwritten answer sheet support using OCR.
🧪 More robust AI models for cross-topic evaluation.
📤 Bulk upload of answer sheets.
🌐 Web-based portal for institutes.
